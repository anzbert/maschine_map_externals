# Maschine Midi Mappings for External Devices

Maschine already contains are large, yet incomplete, selection of MIDI mappings for external devices in the Sounds and Groups, tagged as 'Midi Ext'. This mapping repository is supposed to fill the gaps left by Native Instruments.

# Contribute

Please let me know if you have created other MIDI mappings for Maschine. Contributors are very welcome and I am happy to share this repository with other creators for the sake of the Maschine community!

## Installation

1. To use a specific mapping, download the required file from the Sounds or Groups folder to the following folder on your computer, or Maschine Plus SD card for standalone use:

`Native Instruments/Maschine 2/Sounds`

or

`Native Instruments/Maschine 2/Groups`

Alternaively, you can download all mappings by copying the whole repository into this folder:

`Native Instruments/Maschine 2`

2. Load mapping via drag and drop or the browser and use the mappings via the Macro menu. The mappings will be under 'USER', since they are not provided by NI.

It's best to use the latest firmware for your external gear, since manufacturers sometimes add MIDI communication capabilities in newer versions. The firmware the mapping was designed for is listed in brackets in the list below.

**Of course, make sure to set the correct Midi Device and Channel in the Channel Output Settings!**

| Roland SP404MK2 (3.0+)               | [anzbert](https://community.native-instruments.com/profile/anzbert) | Basic mapping, due to the limited implentation on the SP. Adressable channels are 1: FX1, 2: FX2, 3: FX3, 4:FX4 and 5: InputFX. For Pattern Select Channel 1-10 equal Groups A-J. Chromatic playing only works in Chromatic mode on channel 16. The SP doesn't send CC back to the Maschine when adjusting FX on it. |
