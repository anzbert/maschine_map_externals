# Maschine Midi Mappings for External Devices

A collection of Maschine Midi Mappings for some of my devices. Mappings work on Maschine Plus standalone.

## Installation

To use, copy to this folder:

`Native Instruments/Maschine 2/Sounds`

Load mapping as a Sound into a Pad via the browser and use the mappings via the Macro menu. Make sure to set the correct Midi Device and Channel in the Channel Settings.
